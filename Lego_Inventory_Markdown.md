## Introduction and Purpose
At first, we were given approximately one hundred Lego pieces and were supposed to come up with a structured inventory which included every single Lego piece information and also quantity. These pieces consist of different shapes, sizes, usages and colors which we as a group had to categorize in the right way. In general, the inventory is designed to provide an overview of the stock for a Lego Reselling company.
As for the purpose, after preparing a complete overview of the inventory, we can decide on further planning and also how to deal with various orders. The overview of the inventory in a Google Sheet serves as an assistance to monitor the whole supply and demand flows.

You can find the [inventory here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5OsPttHjQvtAFLUt-rMEAGYMcvyG97LAem_8MwMLfk/edit?gid=450027551#gid=450027551).

## Structure of Inventory

The coloumns of the inventory relate to the shape/size of a piece and the rows correspond to the colour. 

### Size/Shape

Pieces are first divided into general shape categories e.g. square, rectangle, circle, sword. 
The next subcatogy divides shapes based on the number of holes/studs. 
The final subcatgory considers the depth of the piece: 
+ big refers to duplo pieces
+ small refers to standard lego pieces
+ flat refers to pieces that are flat

### Notes on size/shape
We did not label the direction of the slope of a trapezoid.
We did not consider the inner hub of a wheel and the tyre as seperate pieces. 


### Colour

Colours have a general description. Where there are more than two shades of one colour, we have included a second tab with reference photos and RBG to identify the different shades. 

## How to use the inventory

### Incoming Pieces 

#### Previously recieved piece

Locate the piece in the table and increase the number in the cell by 1.

#### New piece

First define if it is the shap, colour or both which are new. 

For a new shape:
+ Decide what level of cateogry needs to be added e.g. is it a new type of sqaure or is it a whole new shape alltogether
+ Add the appropriate columns

For a new colour:
+ Decide if it is a new shade or a whole new colour
+ If it is a new shade of an exisiting colour, create a entry in the colour tab to explain the difference in RGB, alter the names of the shades to make identification easier (e.g. 'light' or 'dark') and then add a row for the new colour

Once the correct rows and column exists, increase the correct cell by 1 to mark the incoming piece. 

### Outgoing Piceces

Locate the piece in the table and decrease the number in the cell by 1.
