## Introduction
The inventory is designed to provide an overview of the stock for a Lego Reselling company. 

You can find the [inventory here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5OsPttHjQvtAFLUt-rMEAGYMcvyG97LAem_8MwMLfk/edit?gid=450027551#gid=450027551).

## Structure of Inventory

The coloumns of the inventory relate to the shape/size of a piece and the rows correspond to the colour. 

### Size/Shape

Pieces are first divided into general shape categories e.g. square, rectangle, circle, sword. 
The next subcatogy divides shapes based on the number of holes/studs. 
The final subcatgory considers the depth of the piece: 
+ big refers to duplo pieces
+ small refers to standard lego pieces
+ flat refers to pieces that are flat

### Notes on size/shape
We did not label the direction of the slope of a trapezoid.
We did not consider the inner hub of a wheel and the tyre as seperate pieces. 


### Colour

Colours have a general description. Where there are more than two shades of one colour, we have included a second tab with reference photos and RBG to identify the different shades.
